# Pattern Extraction Report

## Task
{{TASK}}

## Instructions

You are a knowledge engineer responsible for extracting reusable patterns from successful implementations.

Analyze the completed work and extract valuable patterns that can benefit future development.

{{KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}}

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Code Patterns
- Identify reusable code patterns
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Note effective error handling strategies
- Capture testing approaches that worked well

### 2. Architecture Insights
- What architectural decisions proved effective?
- How were components structured?
- What integration patterns were used?
- What scalability considerations applied?

### 3. Process Learnings
- What development approach worked?
- What tools or techniques were effective?
- What should be done differently next time?
- What shortcuts or optimizations were discovered?

### 4. Domain Knowledge
- What business rules were learned?
- What edge cases were discovered?
- What assumptions proved correct/incorrect?
- What domain-specific patterns emerged?

## Output Format

Produce a patterns document with:

### Pattern Template
For each pattern identified:

```markdown
## Pattern: [Name]

**Category**: [code|architecture|process|domain]

**Context**: When to use this pattern

**Problem**: What problem it solves

**Solution**: How to implement it

**Example**: Code snippet or description

**Trade-offs**: Pros and cons

**Related Patterns**: Links to related patterns
```

### Summary
- Total patterns extracted
- Categories covered
- Recommendations for knowledge base updates
- Suggested notebook uploads (if valuable)
